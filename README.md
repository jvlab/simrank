Analysis of judgments of rank order of similarities

This repository contains code for analysis of rank-order of similarity judgements, along with example data files and a sample processing pipeline. Full documentation can be found in an accompanying pdf.

The main modules are `psg_umi_triplike_demo.m` and `psg_tentlike_demo.m` 

Code is in the directory `psg`.  Raw data files are in `psg/psg_data`.  Intermediate calculations are in `psg` as well.
