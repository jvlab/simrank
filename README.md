Analysis of judgments of rank order of similarities

This repository contains code for analysis of rank-order of similarity judgements, along with example data files and a sample processing pipeline. 
See Victor, J.D., Aguilar, G., and Waraich, S.A. (2023) Ordinal characterization of similarity judgments.  https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543.

Full code documentation can be found in an accompanying pdf, `psg/ord_char_sim_code_v02.pdf`.

The main modules are `psg_umi_triplike_demo.m` and `psg_tentlike_demo.m` 

Code is in the directory `psg`.  Raw data files are in `psg/psg_data`.  Intermediate calculations are in `psg` as well.
